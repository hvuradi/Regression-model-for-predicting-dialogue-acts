Introduction:

Regression model to predict the dialogue act tags for a set of dialogues or sentences.

Feature vectors are generated by calculating the number of unique POS tags for each dialogue in the training data. 
The length of each feature vector is the same length as the number of unique POS tags. The positions in the feature vector are the POS tags. 
For example position 1 is N, position 2 is V, position 3 is ADJ, etc. Each position is filled by the count of that particular POS tag. 
So a feature vector is a list of POS tag counts. 

Training labels are represented as one-hot vectors. The feature set and the training labels are used to train a regression model.

Tools/Libraries used:

Scikit-learn (http://scikit-learn.org/stable/);
NLTK (http://www.nltk.org/)

Training the model:

python train.py
